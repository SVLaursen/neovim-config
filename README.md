# My Neovim Configuration

This is my personal Neovim configuration, which is based upon Primagens really neat setup that you can find [here](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua).
Main changes are that I do not use all of the keymappings made in his setup, and that I have a weakness for the Gruvbox theme!

## Dependencies

In order to user this configuration you must use a package/plugin manager, for this I went with [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim).

When you first set up the configuration, open a Neovim session and enter:

```zsh
:so
:PackerSync
```

After a little second or two all dependencies should be installed and you're ready to go!

## Theme

As mentioned, I have a huge weakness for the Gruvbox theme style, so I've therefore decided to use [ellisonleao's gruvbox.nvim](https://github.com/ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim)
