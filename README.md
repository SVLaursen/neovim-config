# My Neovim Configuration - 2024

My personal refresh of my Neovim configuration. Included are the following features:

- Markdown Previewer with Peek.nvim
- LSP (of course)
- Pretty messages
- Fuzzy searching all over the place
- SAP CDS support for both treesitter and LSP
- And much more... (I think)

## Prerequisites

In order to use this configuration you'll need to following installed on your machine:

- Deno
- Node
-

## TODO

- [ ] Clean up code structure
- [x] Add CDS LSP
- [x] Configure DAP
- [ ] Document how to setup the CDS LSP and TreeSitter
- [ ] Obsidian integration
- [ ] Re-introduce the 'vd' command for inspecting errors
- [ ]Â Figure out why LSP servers configured by Mason are not included when attaching to buffer
